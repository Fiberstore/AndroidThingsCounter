# AndroidThingsCounter

A simple Android Things app that displays a running counter on a I2C Seven Segment display.

It runs on the [PICO-IMX6UL](http://www.wandboard.org/index.php/details/pico-imx6ul) board, but can be easily adapter to run on Raspberry Pi 
by changing the i2c bus name in [HomeActivity.java](app/src/main/java/org/urish/androidthingscounter/HomeActivity.java).
